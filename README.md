# Quantum Kernel Training with Qiskit

This project implements a **Quantum Kernel Learning** algorithm using Qiskit. It includes data preprocessing, quantum circuit construction, and fidelity calculation using IBM Quantum hardware or simulators.

## **Features**
- Reads and processes training data from a CSV file.
- Constructs a quantum feature map and overlap circuits.
- Evaluates kernel matrix elements using Qiskitâ€™s **UnitaryOverlap** circuit.
- Uses **IBM Quantum** hardware for quantum state sampling.
- Visualizes results with **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**.

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
## Quantum Kernel Overlap Plot
- The encoding of classical data into quantum states.
- The entanglement pattern applied between qubits.
- The measurement operations that extract the final probabilities.

## Optimized Quantum Circuit Plot on IBM Quantum Backend
- The transpiled quantum circuit optimized for execution on real quantum hardware.
- Gate rearrangements and optimizations performed by Qiskit's preset pass manager.
- The elimination of idle qubits (`idle_wires=False`), making the circuit more efficient.
- The final structure of the circuit, showing how it will be executed on the IBM Quantum device.
