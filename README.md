# Quantum Kernel Training with Qiskit

This project implements a **Quantum Kernel Learning** algorithm using Qiskit. It includes data preprocessing, quantum circuit construction, and fidelity calculation using IBM Quantum hardware or simulators.

## **Features**
- Reads and processes training data from a CSV file.
- Constructs a quantum feature map and overlap circuits.
- Evaluates kernel matrix elements using Qiskitâ€™s **UnitaryOverlap** circuit.
- Uses **IBM Quantum** hardware for quantum state sampling.
- Visualizes results with **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**.
